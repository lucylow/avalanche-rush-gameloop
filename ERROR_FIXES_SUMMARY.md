# ✅ All Errors Fixed - Summary

## 🎉 Status: Ready to Run!

All critical errors have been identified and fixed. Your Avalanche Rush application is now ready to build and deploy!

---

## 🔧 Errors Fixed

### 1. Import Path Error
**File:** `src/hooks/useAvalancheFeatures.ts`

**Error Message:**
```
Could not resolve "../auth/AuthProvider" from "src/hooks/useAvalancheFeatures.ts"
```

**Root Cause:**
The `AuthProvider.tsx` file is located in the root `auth/` directory, but the import was trying to find it in `src/auth/` (one directory up instead of two).

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Line 562 - Changed from:
export { AuthProvider, AuthContext } from '../auth/AuthProvider';

// To:
export { AuthProvider, AuthContext } from '../../auth/AuthProvider';
```

---

### 2. Missing Route Configuration
**File:** `src/App.tsx`

**Issue:**
New components (LandingPage, NFTDashboard) were created but not added to the routing system.

**Fix:**
Added lazy imports and routes:

```typescript
// Added imports
const LandingPage = lazy(() => import("./pages/LandingPage"));
const NFTDashboard = lazy(() => import("./components/nft/NFTDashboard"));

// Added routes
<Route path="/" element={<MobileResponsiveWrapper><LandingPage /></MobileResponsiveWrapper>} />
<Route path="/nfts" element={<MobileResponsiveWrapper><NFTDashboard /></MobileResponsiveWrapper>} />
<Route path="/nft" element={<MobileResponsiveWrapper><NFTDashboard /></MobileResponsiveWrapper>} />
```
