# 🔧 Fixes Applied - Error Resolution Summary

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ✅ Import Path Error - useAvalancheFeatures.ts

**Error:**
```
Could not resolve "../auth/AuthProvider" from "src/hooks/useAvalancheFeatures.ts"
```

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Before
export { AuthProvider, AuthContext } from '../auth/AuthProvider';

// After
export { AuthProvider, AuthContext } from '../../auth/AuthProvider';
```

**Location:** `src/hooks/useAvalancheFeatures.ts:562`

**Reason:** AuthProvider file is located in the root `auth/` directory, not in `src/auth/`, so we need to go up two directories (`../../`)

### 2. ✅ Missing Routes - Landing Page & NFT Dashboard

**Issue:** New landing page and NFT dashboard components weren't accessible via routes

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Added to App.tsx

// 1. Import LandingPage and NFTDashboard
const LandingPage = lazy(() => import("./pages/LandingPage"));
const NFTDashboard = lazy(() => import("./components/nft/NFTDashboard"));

// 2. Added routes
<Route path="/" element={<MobileResponsiveWrapper><LandingPage /></MobileResponsiveWrapper>} />
<Route path="/home" element={<MobileResponsiveWrapper><Index /></MobileResponsiveWrapper>} />
<Route path="/nfts" element={<MobileResponsiveWrapper><NFTDashboard /></MobileResponsiveWrapper>} />
<Route path="/nft" element={<MobileResponsiveWrapper><NFTDashboard /></MobileResponsiveWrapper>} />
```

**Location:** `src/App.tsx`

**Result:**
- Landing page is now the default home page (`/`)
- Original index moved to `/home`
- NFT dashboard accessible at `/nfts` or `/nft`
